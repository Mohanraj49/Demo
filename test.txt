thly and efficiently in the intended environment.

Here are some key aspects of the deployment process:

Code Compilation and Packaging: Before deploying an application, the source code is typically compiled into executable code, and all necessary files and resources are packaged into a distributable format.

Configuration: Any necessary configuration settings, such as database connections or environment-specific parameters, are set appropriately for the deployment environment.

Installation: The application is installed on the target servers or devices. This can involve copying files, setting up databases, and configuring the environment to support the application.
